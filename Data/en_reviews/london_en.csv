I only saw a little bit of her, because of her work, and my work, but she explained everything very well and was very warm and welcoming. I must appreciate her patience and helpfulness, when in the middle of a work commitment, she managed to have the duplicate set of keys delivered to me ( since i managed to lock myself outside the apartment). She was also very responsive throughout my stay.

The apartment was very very beautiful

I loved staying here. The bedroom was a good size, the living room, the kitchen and the bathroom were Extremely spacious. The location was just perfect. It was extremely well-connected... the tube and bus stations were not even 2 minutes walking, almost over looking the Portobello market, in a very lively area.

The terrace was of course my favorite part, and i loved spending all my free time there.

The apartment was very tastefully done.

I would stay here the next time i'm in London, and I would strongly recommend this place to anyone even remotely considering this apartment.

The apartment was laid out well and was easy to find.  The free WiFi and the roof deck were superb.

Check in/out were a breeze.

The apartment is full of the owner's stuff, so closet space is somewhat limited.

We wiped things down and things were fine.  In the host's defense, she thought we would be arriving a day later than we did.  However, the milk (and some of the other stuff) in the fridge was pretty old and should have been thrown away weeks earlier.

Pros: Chilton was kind, responsive and left some treats for us when we arrived. The terrace was a lovely spot to enjoy the hustle and bustle without being in it. Lots of nice artwork on the walls with comfy couches. Bedroom is small but cosy.

38407,102591,2010-09-22,179117,Dee,"We were lucky enough to find this great deal just in the nick of time before our mom visited from afar and booked for the beginning and end of September. The place was lovely, modern, homey and so superbly located we wanted it for our own! 

Although, primarily, this bedsit is designed for the comfort of two people we were able to all three stay there as privacy was not essential for us and the space comes stocked with a folding cot style bed and the split level saves space and offered enough privacy for us. 

The kitchen is very well equipped and the space has many well thought out home comforts with a unique modern minimalistic style. At the beginning of September it was a bit warm in there during the hot spell in London but there were two large fans provided which saved the day. We also enjoyed the use of the Brita filter, lovely french candles and the organic feel of the place.

The best thing about the place is the ease of access to all the travel routes be it Tube, Bus, DLR or even ferry boat which are all minutes away and all under a half hour to get to centre of London. There is a FANTASTIC modern restaurant serving very reasonably priced gourmet Indian food two steps down which has awesome service and superb dishes as well as a 24 hour food shop around the corner with all sorts of goodies therein.

John was a pleasure to deal with and always easy to reach. We had our share of apprehensions about renting anything off the web as we were on a budget looking for that nice find but only ran in to a lot of scammers. Quick and honest communication back and forth with John put all our worries to rest. 

This place has our seal of approval. :)

Canary Wharf is a cool area with mainly pretty new built houses and skyscrapers. It was easy to take the the tube to London Bridge (only 3 stops) and from there further on. 
The apartment looked pretty much like in the pictures. The bathroom with tub and nice toiletteries was very appreciated and also the well equipped kitchen. Everything worked out very well with John, he was helpful and gave us useful information before we went to London. We were not supposed to meet him but because of my misstake we didn't check out (or maybe I should say didn't check out at all) in time and it was really embarassing. So when we came to get our stuff before heading of to the airport John were there preparing for the coming tenants. I felt so ashamed and had no good excuse accept brain-fag but John handled the situation very well and I'm glad he didn't kill me ;)

The apartment is three blocks from the Brixton tube station, about 10 minutes into the city center by train so the location was great.  Brixton itself is a lively neighborhood with an outdoor market, a movie theatre and a few pubs close to the apartment. 

 
If you are looking only for a bedroom to crash, and a clean, safe and centrally located place to stay while in London, I'd highly recommend staying with Adriano!",en,0.05919395465994962

Adriano is extremely friendly and he put me at ease since I arrived at his flat.
I enjoyed so much his neighborhood, Brixton is amazing and I don't share the opinion of Monique that said it's not a good one.
Probably she didn't like the multicultural aspect of Brixton, while I chose that district intentionally.
As other people wrote Adriano's flat is really close to Brixton Tube Station and there are many bus connections through useful stops and to the City (some of them operate a 24h service)
If you're planning to spend few days in London don't hesitate to contact Adriano!

Location is key and he's right next to the Brixton Station which means that in about 20 minutes or so you can be anywhere you want to be. Beware though that the London Underground is undergoing construction on the weekends and some lines are shut down, nothing that a little bit of planning can solve.

The bed was comfortable, warm and I slept like a baby. Everything was spotless and I couldn't have felt more safe and secure. I'd stay there any time.

Three cheers to Adriano and his beautiful London Flat.

First of all, the house is located in zone 2,  2 mins walk to Brixton tube station (victoria line) and buses to the city centre 24/24 which is very practical. There is everything one need in the area: shops, bars, restaurants, supermarkets.
Then, the house is as shown, our bedroom was cozy and absolutely comfy, and we really appreciated that everything was tidy and super clean including the bathroom which is very important. Moreover, the area was quiet and we slept very well :)
Adriano was so nice and gentle, it was a pleasure to stay at his place. He welcomed us and made us feel home right away. He is a very friendly person and we appreciated nice and interesting conversations with him!

The only things to be aware of is the bed, which was really uncomfortable (you could feel the springs very much press against your ribs), and there was a water-heater or something that was really noisy when it started (also during the night, and we woke many times). 
But besides these two things, the apartment was great and so was John :)",en,0.04940923737916219

We loved having the food available, such as cereals, tea, coffee, jam etc- so we could eat in if we wanted, though there are So many restaurants nearby, that you can try different things every night.
there was a small hic-up with check in, due to a mix up with keys, however this was not Chil fault, and she was incredibly helpful when she discovered the mistake. Thank you for that :-)

Clapham is an amazing neighborhood which I didn't know at all. Clapham road (5mns walking from the apartment) is a living street, restaurants, clubs, markets...
The apartment is extremely well done. Two totally separated bedrooms with a charming living room and it chimney full of charm.

90700,5960965,2013-07-24,4913284,Monica,"This was a different experience for us. The flat was ideally located: tube station, restaurants, groceries, post office, banks, Hyde park, Kensington gardens and more. It felt safe and centrally located.  

The terrace was wonderful and the apartment felt spacious. We enjoyed the floor plan (bathroom was large, living area was spacious and very bright, and the kitchen had plenty of room too.) Although it was incredibly hot in the bedroom and difficult to sleep. Apparently we were there when London was unusually hot. 

That said, the apartment was not as clean as I would have liked. It felt like I was using the flat of a university student who had left for a weekend. There was stuff everywhere (I resorted to using a window ledge for my toiletries and even that had personal supplies on it). The fridge had shelves of half used items that should have been thrown away, the cupboards had boxes of various items that had been spilled in them and not cleaned, the stove had rusty old trays in them.  There was no room for any of our clothes or food. In addition, the sheets, towels, dishes, et cetera, were all mismatched and felt, again, like castoffs from university days. 

It comes down to choices. The location is amazing (a bit loud with traffic - foot and buses which could be expected in a major city) although very hot during heat spell and tidy not clean.   Some people appear to appreciate having the casual nature of the flat. Depends on what each person anticipates. 

I would stay there again for the location, but would have appreciated knowing that it was very different than all of the other five places I rented this summer. Elsewhere I was pampered with high-end linens and spotless living quarters. Here life was good filled with great memories of picnics in the park, Notting Market, M &S take away, adventures with the tube and sitting out on the terrace. 

I am appreciative of the overall experience and would recommend staying here -although only after mentioning its shortcomings -in my opinion.

John is a courteous host and truly cares about the well-being of his guests. I’m happy to recommend John’s apartment. I'll certainly choose it again for future stays in London!

John is a very nice guy and very helpful in making sure that we felt perfectly at home in his flat. Canary Wharf area is perfect for whom wants to be centrally located without the caos of the city, I loved it as it is a very safe but lively area, tube is very close and tesco just 1 min walk from the appartment.

38407,15745536,2014-07-15,10585472,Iris,"We decided to book John's flat for 34 DAYS cause of the great reviews which we've always relied on whenever we travel. Here's our experience:

THE GOOD
*10 mins walk from the tube; 1 min from Tesco supermarket
*Neighborhood was very safe & quiet
*Flat was adequately clean & pretty much had everything
*Host was quick in answering queries
*Had a problem with the iron & it was replaced the ff day
*Host was nice and helpful (at first when I arrived with my husband)

THE WORSE / UNEXPECTED
I'm aware that the check out time is 10 AM since I asked John about it the night before thinking he might be there to check the flat & make sure everything is in good condition before I leave.

Was feeling sick the ff morning but decided I should clean up a bit so not to leave the flat in a dirty condition. I was by myself cause my husband left 2 weeks earlier for work.

Come 10:30 AM, I was still there but almost done packing my stuff. John arrived & continuously rang the doorbell. The moment I opened the door, he barges in, started yelling at me asking why I was still there & that it is very unacceptable. I was quite shocked the way he reacted & apologized but his anger didn't go away. He gave me 30 mins to pack everything & said something like having no choice but to throw me out.

Since I was almost done packing in the first place, I got out of the flat at 11:00 AM. When he came back, I had to tell him he is in the service business & should not treat his clients like that even when they have delayed in checking out. I admit it was my fault & he can be firm in reprimanding BUT the yelling, being verbally abusive, calling his client a ""TRESPASSER"" for checking out an hour late with matching hands on his waist & all up in my face was totally uncalled for. This person ironically even demanded respect after yelling at his client. I just shook my head, said whatever & turned my back to end the nightmare.

I agree he is a nice host but only if everything is going smoothly base on what I experienced. But maintaining professionalism at all times is a compulsory requirement he does not possess.

So despite of the good things, the level of unprofessionalism he displayed, how I felt very degraded & disrespected in the end ruined my entire stay. There are a lot of other good options & I strongly wouldn't recommend this one. Unless you can make sure you won't do anything to set off the host.",en,0.04302477183833116

L'appartamento è esattamente come si vede dalle foto, molto grazioso e ospitale, adatto ad accogliere o una coppia o una piccola famiglia. Una cosa che ci ha notevolmente colpiti e soddisfatto è stato l'estremo livello di pulizia dell'appartamento. Adriano è davvero un ospite eccezionale, gentile. Per qualsiasi cosa si è reso disponibile consigliandoci anche luoghi da visitare e accompagnandoci di persona a fare il giro del quartiere (come da lui promesso in uno dei messaggi prima della partenza). L'alloggio perfetto per poter visitare Londra senza difficoltà e godendo anche di un ottimo appartamento.
Da notare che l'appartamento si trova a 2 minuti a piedi dalla metro in zona 2. Lo terremo in considerazione per altri soggiorni a Londra. Consigliatissimo.

We stayed at Adriano's place at the beginning of September for a week. The flat resambles exactly the pics you find on the website, it is very nice and hospitable and it's perfect for a couple or a small family. One thing that really impressed and satisfied us was the extreme level of cleanliness of the flat. Adriano is indeed a great host, very kind. He has been always available for any request (by phone or mail) and also advised us where to go around the block. He took us around the neighborhood as he promised he would have done in one of the mails we got before the departure. His flat is the perfect accommodation for visiting London easily, while staying in a good flat.
To be noted that the flat is 2 minutes walk away from the Tube in Zone 2. We'll definitely keep this flat in mind for other jorneys in London. Highly recommended.",en,0.03351614868982328

The flat was light, bright and very clean and having the fabulous terrace overlooking the street behind was a bonus even though the weather did not allow us to use it. A bottle of wine, pack of biscuits, milk, basics and helpful maps welcomed us and was a lovely surprise. The wi-fi worked well, the fantastic heating was great and the bed very comfy.

As promised, the location is terrific, a minute from Notting Hill Gate tube station, and close to many pubs and restaurants. The neighborhood can be a bit crowded with tourists over the weekend but once you get inside and sit on the terrace, you feel like a local watching the crowds go by. 

Chil was a great host, and left cookies and wine for us. The kitchen is well equipped and the entire apartment is charming.

The wi-fi worked well, but be forewarned that if you are a TV addict, there is none.  We did not find it a problem.  There is a convenient grocery (Tasco's) just down the main road 1 block west if the Tube station on the North side of the road. Lots of restaurants, bars and movie houses in the neighborhood.

The flat was clean and it was nice to have a place to come back to, however, there wasn't anywhere to really put our things. No place to hang clothes or 'unpack' for the week. The whole point of renting the flat was so we could have a home base, but it didn't really work out like that. A hotel would have been better, especially for the price.

Having a washing machine was a bonus. 
We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Chil all correspondence was via email and we collected the key from a local shop.
We obviously came in the same day the previous guests moved out so the note on the table re eating food in fridge and the bottle of wine was for them.  There was only ""out of date"" yoghurt and milk in the fridge, no wine and the two nearly empty jars of coffee in the cupboard were mouldy, luckily the tea was OK.  Needless to say we went and bought our own provisions. 
The lounge room and bedroom are not as big or bright as the photos suggest. We had to put our cases in the lounge room as the bedroom only has room for the bed which is pushed up against the wall and there is a narrow flight of stairs between the two rooms. There are a few hangers behind the door and a small 3drawer chest if drawers. The bathroom behind the bedroom was a good size with the shower over the bath. A welcome change from the showers in plastic cubicles we had experienced over the preceding 5weeks in Europe. 
On the whole the flat was clean, the cleaner had been that morning, although all the curtains could do with a wash. 
I would recommend Chil's flat for its convenience.

I used the kitchen on a number of occasions and found it well equipped, clean and efficient. The living room is sunny and bright, the bedroom quiet and cosy. All facilities (plumbing, lighting, heating, cooking, wifi, etc.) were working as expected.
I have also to say a few words about Adriano himself. I was delayed on arrival, but Adriano didn't show the least annoyance; he greeted me warmly and spent time going over all the details of the flat. As you can see from his text, Adriano's a big fan of Brixton and he encouraged me to explore its various and colourful offerings. He even accompanied me to the Brixton market to show me some of his favorite shops.
The flat is very conveniently located a few steps away from the Victoria line tube. Getting there involves wading through crowds of people that seem to continuously swarm around the Brixton tube station and adjoining market area. In spite of all this frenetic activity however, the flat being on a quiet side street is isolated from the clamour. The only noise I heard from the flat were fire crackers on the evening of my 5 November arrival : I hadn't reckoned on Guy Fawkes! The rest of my stay was quiet and very calm.
In short, I was entirely satisfied with my choice of this Brixton flat and found my host to be a most friendly, helpful and considerate person.",en,0.05761843790012804
11551,8981564,2013-11-30,7652631,Peter,"Everyone else has fairly accurately summed up the experience with Adriano and his lovely flat in Brixton.  Location and convenience cannot be beat.  A hop, skip and a jump from the Underground (Metro), plus access to several buslines available on the High Street makes for easy transport to just about anywhere in London. The apartment itself is clean and well organized. The kitchen is well equipped...enough for us to prepare a small Thanksgiving feast for a few friends.  The building is quiet.  The neighborhood is well appointed with stores, restaurants, and things of interest. There is plenty of heat in the apartment, it is well lite with lots of windows for getting sunlight, fresh air and a nice view of the street and outside world.  The one problem/issue is something out of Adriano's control.  The building itself and the entrance to the building is in dire need of maintenance and upkeep.  If you're familiar with British construction and maintenance techniques, you might not be too shocked because this is standard issue.   If you come to his apartment, prepare for this.  But, once inside, you will be happy. you rented",en,0.05069124423963134

Rather than having to stay in their small flat we were able to use this spacious and clean apartment which is so very close to the centre of Brixton.  

We were happy to find that the road is quiet - we had expected a lot of noise at night and early morning but despite being so close to Brixton High Street, it was not noisy at all. 

The beds are fine, the kitchen well-equipped and the lounge/diner was perfectly comfortable enough to be a home from home when required.  

The apartment t is fantastically conveniently situated and would be perfect for a few days in London.  Streams of buses pass the end of the road going to every part of central London and the apartment is just a couple of minutes walk from Brixton tube station which give access to Victoria and Oxford Circus in a very few minutes.

The location of the flat is very conveniently located and easy to walk to from the Brixton tube station, railway station or bus-stop. We found nearby Brixton Village to be the best place to find dinner, and there were many convenience stores nearby so we could easily fill our fridge with snacks and breakfast food. The kitchen was well-equipped, and the flat itself was very clean and contemporary; everything seemed new, comfortable and stylish. I was really glad to be able to do a load of laundry - a washing machine is discreetly tucked into the kitchen. Communication with Adriano was easy and he quickly responded to my emails and texts. He's very friendly, professional and organized. He gave us a quick tour of the flat and some tips about the neighbourhood and then left us to begin our adventures in London.

90700,33424875,2015-05-28,25571258,Alain,"Dear Airbnb team!
The experience with Chil's flat was the most awfull we had in the last 15 years.
Firstly, the flat is very noisy, being situated at a crossroads very near Nottinghill Gate. Many bus lines have stations in the immediate vicinity - their (starting and other) noises surround the appartment and are audible very well inside (day and most of night), and on the terrace. In our opinion, the terrace is unusable because of the noise and the bad air, and not situated in a courtyard and has no patio situation, as Airbnb fotos suggest.
Secondly, the appartment's bedroom is very small (2 times 2.3 meters) - the only window in it is closed/barred. Thus, there is not enough air in the room for two persons, and ventilation is impossible (see details below). One side of the bed lengthens the wall, the window and a curtain. That is, the person sleeping wallside has to be habituated to such a position, and is not able to leave the bed without massively disturbing the other.
Thirdly, it is almost impossible to ventilate the rooms. There are four windows. Two (bedroom, bath) are closed/barred, the one in the bathroom having a very noisy ventilator which is about 1 meter from the head end of the bed, and is connected to a light. So it is impossible to let it run during night in order to ventilate the bedroom indirectly. Two windows may be opened but are going into the street where cars and busses pass by without interruption, day and night.
Forthly, the appartment is not clean at all - one may see it everywhere. Moreover and most importantly, on the whole it has a humid atmosphere and smells musty (the mildew is behind the boiler in the kitchen). After we had taken a shower, we used the provided towels - they smelled horribly and never again became dry. We were really in sorrow about the musty air and afraid of our health - we left after one day and two nights (we booked 6 nights) and changed to a nearby hotel.
Fifthly, the appartment is much smaller than the fotos on Airbnb suggest. There is so few space left and no armoire, and thus it was impossible to unpack the luggage.
Sixthly. Airbnb and Chil suggest a personal or private way of travelling. We never saw Chil, the bottle of welcome wine promised in Chil's letter on the table was nowhere etc.  - the appartment looked not as if persons other than tourists ever live in it.
In sum: Not cosy, not charming, not clean, no private home, almost the contrary of what is advertised on Airbnb, far too much expensive. For us a fake, almost a fraud. Our fotos are available - they do not correspond well with those on Airbnb. Our fault was probably that we were unable to look behind the fotos and to read between the lines.
With greetings from two quinquagenarians living in Vienna

The apartment is mostly as per the photos. My main disappointment was the terrace is rather exposed and less pleasant than I had hoped from the photos.

I arrived slightly early due to making it through Heathrow quicker than I expected and was met by the cleaner after a short wait. I found the apartment hadn't been cleaned and so the cleaner went to work while I waited, which was a shame as I was exhausted after 24 hours of travel to get there and just wanted to shower and sleep.

Unfortunately on the first night there was a continuous loud alarm noise near the bedroom from around 11pm until 7:00am the next morning that made it almost impossible to sleep. This alarm wasn't from the apartment itself and Chil was very quick to respond once I contacted her. I think was a strange one-off occurrence and it didn't happen again for me and I am sure can't be a regular thing or others would have surely mentioned it.

I enjoyed the light interior and art works and also loved the location and private entry door straight off the street. The bathroom is showing its age in the tile grout, toilet seat etc. Bedroom was adequate; would have been a challenge with a 2nd guest due to the location of the bed against the wall. Also the room wasn't big enough for me to open my (large) suitcase and the bedroom door at the same time.

Fantastic location (literally 2 minutes walk to Brixton Station), a very nice and well equipped space and Adriano is an excellent and very friendly host.  I would definitely recommend this flat to anyone coming to London wanting to stay close to Central, but away from the tourist area.  Everything you could need is within an easy walk on the rainy days when you don't want to venture far, and at the same time, it's just minutes on the tube to get to central London. If you enjoy Brixton life, you will love Adriano's flat.  I would definitely stay here again.",en,0.052083333333333336

Tesco (grocery store) was also right around the block, which was convenient since we visited it 3 times during our short stay.  Visiting central London was only about a 15-20 minute ride by the Underground, and slightly longer by double-decker bus.  If it is your first time visiting London (as it was mine), I would recommend researching the public transportation options if that will be your means of transportation.  I had not done so, and Adriano was helpful in discussing some options, but we would have had more options with advance planning.  I would recommend the apartment to someone looking for a good deal and willing to be slightly outside of central London.  We saved about half vs. the hotel I had booked in Victoria; and had more room, a full kitchen, etc.",en,0.03976608187134503

Little noise at nights throughout the week, but on weekends there was plenty of noise, so just be prepared for that on Friday and Saturday nights (yet it is London). Well stocked kitchen made preparing meals easy, with a large supermarket 5 minutes walk away. Main bed was comfy and the bathroom spacious for the size of the apartment.

Her flat is comfortable, homey, very sunny, and quiet at night. Her diverse neighborhood rocks! It's full of excellent eateries of varying ethnicities, good supermarkets, etc., etc. Her place is about a 10-minute walk to the Finsbury Park tube stop, and there are also several buses that ply Stroud Green Road. The Piccadilly and Victoria tube lines that serve Finsbury Park are very dependable and come frequently. My only caveat is if you are unwilling to take 20- to 40-minute commutes to downtown London attractions and money is no object, you will prefer to stay downtown.

They are very friendly and offer great suggestions on getting around of what you might want to do.  Even with my extended stay I saw them infrequently due to my schedule keeping me out all day and coming back late. I never felt unsafe even coming in near midnight walking from downtown. 

The flat is off the main street so inside you have no road noise and compared to the hotel I stayed in the first two nights of my trip it was much quieter since the room over looks their garden.  The bed is comfortable and room is warm.

The location has great food all along the walk to and from Shepherds Bush Market which I mainly used, but Shepards Bush was not more than 2.5 minutes further to walk to if you want other Tube connections.  The breakfast options were diverse and plenty to get you going in the morning.  They have a small pet tortoise that roams the kitchen and was friendly company in the mornings.

The place was perfectly comfortable and Philippa gave a lot of helpful information prior to our arrival in England.

However, me and my girlfriend were robbed the second night we were there.  We went out to meet friends and by the time we got back, all of our valuables were taken (computers, iPods, camera equipment, jewelry, etc).  It was upon the arrival of the police that we learned two things:
1)  Rooms here are rented out very, very frequently.  There are always people in and out so it is very obvious that there are tourists coming in and out of here.
2) The locks, as explained by the police, are very inadequate at this location and can be circumvented with extremely simple tactics.

The most aggravating part of this was how we were treated.  We followed all instructions exactly as they were laid out and were very deliberate in making sure everything was perfectly secure as we went in and out of the place.  However, all correspondence with Philippa (through email or through her neighbor) indicated nothing other than it somehow being our fault.  There was very little sympathy and all the commentary centered around what WE did.  Additionally, Philippa basically just stopped replying to emails after we expressed how frustrated we were from her responses and the lack of security and safety in the building.

So, it is a nice place and a convenient location, but the threat of robbery (or God forbid attacks) is just simply too high here.",en,0.0423728813559322

Some of the buses run all night so if you want to go out and are a little low on money for the cab you can always take one f them to go home!
It is ideal if you want to do some sightseeing and party in London while living in a nice and calm area. Of course you'll have to be very quiet while coming back home because it is a residential area and that's what make it so nice. 
Lovely shop stores around on King's road, the Saatchi gallery is at 10 minutes walking, the grocery store is literally  around the corner.
Saint-Pancras station for those who take the Eurostar is in the same tube station at 45 minutes top. Most of the tourist spots are within 20 minutes.

The apartment itself is very quiet at night a little less in the morning because it is located next to a store delivery parking. No worries then close the windows turn on the air conditioner or put some ear plugs if you are like me (light sleeper) it only lasts an hour.

It is exactly as indicated in the add. Beautiful natural light that makes it very bright. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom with fresh towels and toilet paper (seems silly to point it but very useful when you arrive late and haven't got time to go to the market) and an equipped kitchen. Everything you need for your stay as a true Londoner!

Philippa is a very lovely and warm lady. I am sure she will make your stay as comfortable as ours.

It's really easy to get around London from there : 
I recommend buying an Oyster Transport pass for the Tube and buses.

The apartment was wonderfully located with a supermarket, pastry shops and so many restaurants within walking distance, ie just around the corner. Ditto for public transportation - bus stop just around the corner that served us as ""tour"" buses since the routes went by every known site you could wish to visit. Within walking distance the Victoria and Albert museum and the Natural history musuem, the beautiful church of St. Luke with its gardens just at the end of the street.

And the apartment itself was incredibly comfortable, with a washing machine and dishwasher and enough kitchen utensils for breakfast or any other meal you would want to prepare.

The neighborhood was exceptionally  quiet  in the evening with only the routine morning noise of the city of London waking in the morning.

Phillipa made checking in and out a breeze, and kindly left us some milk in the fridge, and made certain we understood how everything worked.

Both of us arrived from Amsterdam a day into head colds. Philippa was kind enough to direct us to the ""electric fire"" she keeps tucked away so we were able to be a bit warmer on our sickest day.

Philippa is a great host making certain we knew where everything was and how it operated in the flat. We enjoyed being on the ground level for a change. Usually our accommodations  away from home seem to be on the fifth and sixth floors without lifts.

Philippa will be starting a remodeling soon so it wil be interesting to stay when she has completed that to see the changes. They undoubtedly will be stunning.

Special note: I needed to fax a document back to the States and asked Philippa about businesses that provided those such as FedEx and MailBoxes Etc. There is a MBE near the South Kensington Underground however Philippa advised that her printer should do that (wouldn't connect for me as a scanner but worked fine as a copier/printer). The alternative were free services at the Town Hall across Kings Road. I ended up at the library at that building. William helped me join the library and then made an appointment for me at the computer station that would scan my document so I could send it as an attachment to an email.

90700,49418161,2015-10-04,12849189,Kai,"We are newlyweds having our honeymoon in London 3 days after our wedding. We stayed here for 5 nights in Sep/Oct 2015. Due to our busy planning for the wedding the week before, we only finalized our check-in details 2 days prior. We arrived at the unit at 10am and were greeted by Chil's cleaner who briefly showed us around the house. What we loved most is the location to the tube (about 2 mins walk). We also liked the lounge area which had heaters and comfy couch and the terrace because we can have hot meals outdoors and enjoy the lovely breeze (something we don't get in Malaysia). The pantry is quite well equipped with a working oven and microwave and they have a nice medium sized fridge. We happened to be able to enjoy the 'Indian summer' during our stay. What we didn't like were the bedroom because it didn't have heater so it was quite chilly all the time and traffic noise (loudest from 8am - 10pm) because the unit is located at the intersection of 2 busy roads. Also, the pillow cases from the bedroom had a musty smell. Overall, it was a cosy stay for a holiday but not really for honeymoon because the bedroom was too chilly for us to sleep in (maybe it was autumn and we are not used to the cool weather).",en,0.05089058524173028

The location is unbeatable and anyone who has ever been to Notting Hill before and loves wandering around that part of the city will know this by looking it up on a map. Also, Notting Hill Gate as one major station to explore the center of London is just a few steps away.
The apartment itself is nice and offers anything you need: a nice place to sit in the living area (actually quite big for London), a kitchen with all general supplies, a small bedroom which is in the back of the apartment, not directly facing the street and a clean bathroom. We stayed there during Pre-Christmas Season, so we did not really use the balcony but we could image the highlight of sitting up there during warmer days and watch people in the streets.
Chil was really easy and quick in communication, no problems at all.

Chil’s immediate responses throughout the booking process and that continued until the day we arrived in London on late evening eve of Christmas impressed us. The apartment is exactly as described and shown:- clean and neat, 1 min walk to Notting Hill Gate metro station. Tesco, M&S and everything we need was within 5 - 10 mins walk. Plus point that it is located near the famous Portobello district, lending lively and safe atmosphere. The kitchen is equipped with almost all utensils and crockeries. Chil had prepared the necessity like cereal, milk, floor, oil etc. A saviour as all shops and transportations were closed on Christmas Day. We are thankful for her kind gesture.
We spent our daily morning coffee at the beautiful patio while watching the dark winter sky cleared up. It was a nice addition to the memorable stay.
The only downside is the small bedroom. The room is without closet or space to fit our clothes except for the 3 drawers. With limited storage space, we left most of our clothes in the suitcases in the  living room. The angle of the bed is quite awkward that the one sleeping nearer to the wall has to crawl in or out from the side of bed when the other is sleeping. However, Chil made up for it all with her thoughtfulness. We would certainly stay in the apartment again in future. Thank you.

First the good - because of its location near a lot of nice shopping and restaurants (including a supermarket, Waitrose, nearby) our stay was comfortable. The number 11 bus which stops nearby takes you to within 15 minutes walking of most major sights. The bad thing about the location is it is right behind the Waitrose.

The bed was comfortable and everything such as towels, hairdryer and extra if needed were catered for.

We went to eat at a restaurant we could see from the terrace so not far to walk! Also visited the local pub, which was bustlingly busy with a great atmosphere. Tried a restaurant called Polpo, which was excellent.

Superb location for the Tube, we also walked down to take a walk through Hyde Park to the Albert Memorial. I lovely place to come back to after a busy day out!

17402,1964976,2012-08-13,1447834,Wendy,"The apartment was in a great central location for the Olympics and very close to the underground and restaurants.  It was a clean (except for some silver fish in one of the bathrooms) and comfortable apartment.  I was not happy with the number of bathroom towels provided.  There were 5 of us so we were given 5 bath towels, 2 hand towels and no wash clothes.  We were there for 9 days and the washing machine broke early in our stay.  Our towels got a little ripe by the end or our stay. 

Liz was responsive when we emailed her, but I would have liked better communication on confirming our stay as it got closer.  We paid for the flat 6 months in advance because it was for the Olympics so I started to get worried when I did not hear from her.  I finally emailed her just over a week before we were to arrive to confirm our stay and find out how we were to access the flat.  When she responded, she confirmed the place but said nothing about accessing it.  Finally a day before we were to arrive she emailed the access info. 

Lastly, The second day we were there the washing/dryer machine jammed and would not open.  Liz sent someone out to fix it and told us it was a broken handle, but didn't let us know it wouldn't be fixed until after we were gone.  We found this out only after sending an inquiring email.  She never once talked with us about paying for the repair.  When we got home we received an email from an Airbnb mediator to pay for the repair.   Through Airbnb we came to a compromise and paid half of the repair though we did not break the handle.  Liz is responsive and nice, but often does not initiate communication when it would be appropriate and helpful.  ",en,0.04903786468032278

Firstly, Liz couldn't have been nicer to us!The flat was even better that in the pictures. Everything was great, (two bathrooms and 3 bedrooms). Location couldn't have been better. Everything was within walking distance(british museum, candem town, oxford circuss, pica dilly) or you could get the Warren Street Tube and you arrived everywhere in less than five minutes. The house was very near to Tesco Express and Salsbury Supermarkets, Pharmacies and everything you could ever head. Furthermore, the best night clubs in London (Libertine, Maddox and Cirque du Soire) were all a 15 minute walk. We stayed four days and we didn't have to pick any taxi!. The great majority of the Buses stopped in Tottenham Court Row(less than 3 minute walk from the house). 
I definitely recommend this house, as when we arrived, it couldn't be more clean. There was a dishwasher, washing machine, iron...everything you could need.
We didn't stay much on the flat as we went on a tourist trip, but it was extremely pleasant arriving to the flat,as it was great located and beds were extremely confortable.

One downside of being well located is that the flat tends to be very noisy at night. Directly across the street is a 140 room LSE student residence, and with a student pub on the street corner, there is a lot of activity directly below the flat between the pub and the residence. We stayed for seven nights, and basically every night was very noisy until late.
This three bedroom flat would be a decent place to stay for the money except for one thing - two of the three beds have extremely poor quality mattresses. Before renting the flat, I specifically asked Liz about the mattress quality, and she assured me that the mattresses were of good quality. Well this was unfortunately for me and my family a blatant misrepresentation. One bed has a decent double mattress. The other two beds have really really bad mattresses, the kind where the springs are to the surface and little or no support or padding. To make matters worse, one of the beds has broken slats, so you sort of ooze downward in the middle. I reported this after our first (sleepless) night, and Liz's partner Jack came over to the flat. I showed him the two bad mattresses, and he seemed surprised at how bad they were, said he agreed that they were not of acceptable quality, and that he'd try to get them replaced immediately, but given it was a Saturday he said in all likelihood we wouldn't get new mattresses delivered until Monday. I said that was ok, and I appreciated his honesty about how bad the mattresses were, and his willingness to deal with the situation. Well, on Monday no mattresses arrived, nor any message from Jack or Liz about a change of plans. After two of my emails went unanswered, Liz finally answered to say that the existing mattresses were actually fine (!), that she's slept in the flat many times and that she's never had complaints before!!!! She didn't bother explaining how Jack could have been so wrong in his assessment. She had the nerve to tell me ""different beds suit different people I guess"". If the two mattresses were not of throw-away quality, why would Jack suggest replacing them immediately if they were not crappy?? The reason i'm making a big deal of this, as I've told Liz, is that the ONLY question I had of Liz before renting the flat was whether the mattresses were of decent quality.  She misrepresented the facts, and then despite her partner Jack agreeing with me, she would not admit she had lied to me. So buyer beware of what Liz has to say! I would suggest looking elsewhere.

I think they should do more to ensure guest driving remember because no where else in London do these rules apply and so it's not something as a driver that you automatically think about.
