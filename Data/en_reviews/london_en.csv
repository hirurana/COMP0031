Nonetheless, he was a very gracious host. The neighborhood is not a good one, and anyone renting here should be aware of that. I would not walk in that area at night under any circumstances.

Valerio kindly prepared coffee and set breakfast for us every day :)
Adriano is very knowledgeable of the city and places you should visit and ways to get there. He advised us on places to go, sights, and everything.

If you are looking for a nice, cosy and super clean room in London, you will be happy to stay at Adrianos and Valerios place. The both are friendly and welcoming hosts. They serve you a good breakfast with italian cappuccino in the morning. And if you are interested you can also have a nice discussion with Adriano and learn a lot about European culture and history. Thanks again for that!:) We just stayed one night at their appartment, but if we come back we will definitely try to stay at this place.

The apartment is three blocks from the Brixton tube station, about 10 minutes into the city center by train so the location was great.  Brixton itself is a lively neighborhood with an outdoor market, a movie theatre and a few pubs close to the apartment.

Adriano is extremely friendly and he put me at ease since I arrived at his flat.
I enjoyed so much his neighborhood, Brixton is amazing and I don't share the opinion of Monique that said it's not a good one.
Probably she didn't like the multicultural aspect of Brixton, while I chose that district intentionally.
As other people wrote Adriano's flat is really close to Brixton Tube Station and there are many bus connections through useful stops and to the City (some of them operate a 24h service)
If you're planning to spend few days in London don't hesitate to contact Adriano!

Location is key and he's right next to the Brixton Station which means that in about 20 minutes or so you can be anywhere you want to be. Beware though that the London Underground is undergoing construction on the weekends and some lines are shut down, nothing that a little bit of planning can solve.

The bed was comfortable, warm and I slept like a baby. Everything was spotless and I couldn't have felt more safe and secure. I'd stay there any time.

We really enjoyed this experience!
First of all, the house is located in zone 2,  2 mins walk to Brixton tube station (victoria line) and buses to the city centre 24/24 which is very practical. There is everything one need in the area: shops, bars, restaurants, supermarkets.
Then, the house is as shown, our bedroom was cozy and absolutely comfy, and we really appreciated that everything was tidy and super clean including the bathroom which is very important. Moreover, the area was quiet and we slept very well :)
Adriano was so nice and gentle, it was a pleasure to stay at his place. He welcomed us and made us feel home right away. He is a very friendly person and we appreciated nice and interesting conversations with him!

Another guest commented on the state of the entrance and, yes, it could be improved. But once inside the flat, its a whole different story. The accommodation is airy, comfortable and modern. I used the kitchen on a number of occasions and found it well equipped, clean and efficient. The living room is sunny and bright, the bedroom quiet and cosy. All facilities (plumbing, lighting, heating, cooking, wifi, etc.) were working as expected.
I have also to say a few words about Adriano himself. I was delayed on arrival, but Adriano didn't show the least annoyance; he greeted me warmly and spent time going over all the details of the flat. As you can see from his text, Adriano's a big fan of Brixton and he encouraged me to explore its various and colourful offerings. He even accompanied me to the Brixton market to show me some of his favorite shops.
The flat is very conveniently located a few steps away from the Victoria line tube. Getting there involves wading through crowds of people that seem to continuously swarm around the Brixton tube station and adjoining market area. In spite of all this frenetic activity however, the flat being on a quiet side street is isolated from the clamour. The only noise I heard from the flat were fire crackers on the evening of my 5 November arrival : I hadn't reckoned on Guy Fawkes! The rest of my stay was quiet and very calm.
In short, I was entirely satisfied with my choice of this Brixton flat and found my host to be a most friendly, helpful and considerate person.",en,0.05761843790012804

A hop, skip and a jump from the Underground (Metro), plus access to several buslines available on the High Street makes for easy transport to just about anywhere in London. The apartment itself is clean and well organized. The kitchen is well equipped...enough for us to prepare a small Thanksgiving feast for a few friends.  The building is quiet.  The neighborhood is well appointed with stores, restaurants, and things of interest. There is plenty of heat in the apartment, it is well lite with lots of windows for getting sunlight, fresh air and a nice view of the street and outside world.  The one problem/issue is something out of Adriano's control.  The building itself and the entrance to the building is in dire need of maintenance and upkeep.

Being a stone's throw from the Victoria Line was really handy, and Brixton is always buzzing so location was great.

The location of the flat is very conveniently located and easy to walk to from the Brixton tube station, railway station or bus-stop. We found nearby Brixton Village to be the best place to find dinner, and there were many convenience stores nearby so we could easily fill our fridge with snacks and breakfast food. The kitchen was well-equipped, and the flat itself was very clean and contemporary; everything seemed new, comfortable and stylish. I was really glad to be able to do a load of laundry - a washing machine is discreetly tucked into the kitchen. Communication with Adriano was easy and he quickly responded to my emails and texts. He's very friendly, professional and organized. He gave us a quick tour of the flat and some tips about the neighbourhood and then left us to begin our adventures in London.

That's fine if you have Netflix or happy watching YouTube and bbc iplayer. The bedroom could do with a really good clean, the bed was comfortable but the room felt very wore to the rest of the flat.

The place was perfectly comfortable and Philippa gave a lot of helpful information prior to our arrival in England.

However, me and my girlfriend were robbed the second night we were there.  We went out to meet friends and by the time we got back, all of our valuables were taken (computers, iPods, camera equipment, jewelry, etc).  It was upon the arrival of the police that we learned two things:
1)  Rooms here are rented out very, very frequently.  There are always people in and out so it is very obvious that there are tourists coming in and out of here.
2) The locks, as explained by the police, are very inadequate at this location and can be circumvented with extremely simple tactics.

The most aggravating part of this was how we were treated.  We followed all instructions exactly as they were laid out and were very deliberate in making sure everything was perfectly secure as we went in and out of the place.  However, all correspondence with Philippa (through email or through her neighbor) indicated nothing other than it somehow being our fault.  There was very little sympathy and all the commentary centered around what WE did.  Additionally, Philippa basically just stopped replying to emails after we expressed how frustrated we were from her responses and the lack of security and safety in the building.

So, it is a nice place and a convenient location, but the threat of robbery (or God forbid attacks) is just simply too high here.",en,0.0423728813559322

The place is located in lovely Chelsea, seconds away from scores of shops, restaurants and pubs.  There is also a supermarket and cinema literally right around the corner.  If your only in London a few days and are primarily sight-seeing, the place is within walking distance to two metro stations and two or three tube stops to Westminister, Soho and Southbank  (about 20 mins total time).   A really great option for quick and easy access to central London with a quieter, trendy and less tourist neighbourhood to come home too.  And for anyone traveling from North America, London public transit is an absolute dream in comparison.

The apartment itself is very cute, perfectly clean and very well out-fitted.  Everything was recieved exactly as promised in the ad.  Phillipa was a kind and helpful host.  We would definitely recommend this place.  Great visit!",en,0.05698924731182796

Some of the buses run all night so if you want to go out and are a little low on money for the cab you can always take one f them to go home!
It is ideal if you want to do some sightseeing and party in London while living in a nice and calm area. Of course you'll have to be very quiet while coming back home because it is a residential area and that's what make it so nice. 
Lovely shop stores around on King's road, the Saatchi gallery is at 10 minutes walking, the grocery store is literally  around the corner.
Saint-Pancras station for those who take the Eurostar is in the same tube station at 45 minutes top. Most of the tourist spots are within 20 minutes.

The apartment itself is very quiet at night a little less in the morning because it is located next to a store delivery parking. No worries then close the windows turn on the air conditioner or put some ear plugs if you are like me (light sleeper) it only lasts an hour.

It is exactly as indicated in the add. Beautiful natural light that makes it very bright. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom with fresh towels and toilet paper (seems silly to point it but very useful when you arrive late and haven't got time to go to the market) and an equipped kitchen. Everything you need for your stay as a true Londoner!

Philippa is a very lovely and warm lady. I am sure she will make your stay as comfortable as ours. 
I am glad I've met her and I hope next time I'll go to London her appartment will be free for me to rent it!

It's really easy to get around London from there : 
I recommend buying an Oyster Transport pass for the Tube and buses. 
I was even able to use it on a couple of regular trains.
Lots of great shops right nearby, including a wonderful large grocery store.

The apartment was wonderfully located with a supermarket, pastry shops and so many restaurants within walking distance, ie just around the corner. Ditto for public transportation - bus stop just around the corner that served us as ""tour"" buses since the routes went by every known site you could wish to visit. Within walking distance the Victoria and Albert museum and the Natural history musuem, the beautiful church of St. Luke with its gardens just at the end of the street.

And the apartment itself was incredibly comfortable, with a washing machine and dishwasher and enough kitchen utensils for breakfast or any other meal you would want to prepare.

Philippa is a great host making certain we knew where everything was and how it operated in the flat. We enjoyed being on the ground level for a change. Usually our accommodations  away from home seem to be on the fifth and sixth floors without lifts.

Philippa will be starting a remodeling soon so it wil be interesting to stay when she has completed that to see the changes. They undoubtedly will be stunning.

Special note: I needed to fax a document back to the States and asked Philippa about businesses that provided those such as FedEx and MailBoxes Etc. There is a MBE near the South Kensington Underground however Philippa advised that her printer should do that (wouldn't connect for me as a scanner but worked fine as a copier/printer). The alternative were free services at the Town Hall across Kings Road. I ended up at the library at that building.

Excellent apartment and exactly as described in the listing, down to the nice pub around the corner and the very relaxing gardens at St. Luke's. Safe, vibrant neighborhood and the location can't be beat. Bus stops right around the corner, underground stations a 3 minute bus ride or 10 minute walk away. Full service market also right around the corner. Several eating choices within a short walk.  The apartment was warm and cozy and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. 

Philippa was an outstanding host. Once we booked she provided us a wealth of information on the apartment and the neighborhood to get us orientated and despite the late hour of our arrival she was there to meet us and get us settled. The apartment has internet and Philippa had a number of maps and guides to help plan our London vacation. If relaxing with a good book is on the agenda, she has a nice assortment to choose from. 

All-in-all a five star experience. I would not hesitate to recommend Philippa's apartment to my friends.

Unfortunately, we did not meet either Phillipa or any other person during our stay. Fortunately, we were able to get to the keys and successfully enter the apartment.

First the good - because of its location near a lot of nice shopping and restaurants (including a supermarket, Waitrose, nearby) our stay was comfortable. The number 11 bus which stops nearby takes you to within 15 minutes walking of most major sights. The bad thing about the location is it is right behind the Waitrose.

Our towels got a little ripe by the end or our stay. 

Liz was responsive when we emailed her, but I would have liked better communication on confirming our stay as it got closer.  We paid for the flat 6 months in advance because it was for the Olympics so I started to get worried when I did not hear from her.  I finally emailed her just over a week before we were to arrive to confirm our stay and find out how we were to access the flat.  When she responded, she confirmed the place but said nothing about accessing it.  Finally a day before we were to arrive she emailed the access info. 

Lastly, The second day we were there the washing/dryer machine jammed and would not open.  Liz sent someone out to fix it and told us it was a broken handle, but didn't let us know it wouldn't be fixed until after we were gone.  We found this out only after sending an inquiring email.  She never once talked with us about paying for the repair.  When we got home we received an email from an Airbnb mediator to pay for the repair.   Through Airbnb we came to a compromise and paid half of the repair though we did not break the handle.  Liz is responsive and nice, but often does not initiate communication when it would be appropriate and helpful.  ",en,0.04903786468032278

Pros: 
Location is close to several tube stations making it easy to get around the city.
Lots of space where you can really spread out, bright with lots of windows.
Numerous restaurants and pubs nearby to get something to eat or drink.
Close to several grocery and pharmacy.
Liz provided a nice welcome guide with recommendations. 

Cons:
Several baby silverfish in the bathrooms.
Front bedroom facing the street can be very noisy at night with pub patrons on their way home. (back two bedrooms were quiet).

17402,10523344,2014-02-23,12085881,Marta,"I went with five more friends to Liz's apartment in Fitzroy Street. Surely, the best apartment i have ever been to. Firstly, Liz couldn't have been nicer to us!The flat was even better that in the pictures. Everything was great, (two bathrooms and 3 bedrooms). Location couldn't have been better. Everything was within walking distance(british museum, candem town, oxford circuss, pica dilly) or you could get the Warren Street Tube and you arrived everywhere in less than five minutes. The house was very near to Tesco Express and Salsbury Supermarkets, Pharmacies and everything you could ever head. Furthermore, the best night clubs in London (Libertine, Maddox and Cirque du Soire) were all a 15 minute walk. We stayed four days and we didn't have to pick any taxi!. The great majority of the Buses stopped in Tottenham Court Row(less than 3 minute walk from the house). 
I definitely recommend this house, as when we arrived, it couldn't be more clean. There was a dishwasher, washing machine, iron...everything you could need.
We didn't stay much on the flat as we went on a tourist trip, but it was extremely pleasant arriving to the flat,as it was great located and beds were extremely confortable.
I wont regret staying again in Liz's apartment!",en,0.05004240882103478

17402,25687272,2015-01-23,23242286,Cam,"The flat is well located, a short walk to two tubes stations (Victoria line and Northern line). There is good informational material sent in advance to help with arrival, and good reference material in the flat.
One downside of being well located is that the flat tends to be very noisy at night. Directly across the street is a 140 room LSE student residence, and with a student pub on the street corner, there is a lot of activity directly below the flat between the pub and the residence. We stayed for seven nights, and basically every night was very noisy until late.
This three bedroom flat would be a decent place to stay for the money except for one thing - two of the three beds have extremely poor quality mattresses. Before renting the flat, I specifically asked Liz about the mattress quality, and she assured me that the mattresses were of good quality. Well this was unfortunately for me and my family a blatant misrepresentation. One bed has a decent double mattress. The other two beds have really really bad mattresses, the kind where the springs are to the surface and little or no support or padding. To make matters worse, one of the beds has broken slats, so you sort of ooze downward in the middle. I reported this after our first (sleepless) night, and Liz's partner Jack came over to the flat. I showed him the two bad mattresses, and he seemed surprised at how bad they were, said he agreed that they were not of acceptable quality, and that he'd try to get them replaced immediately, but given it was a Saturday he said in all likelihood we wouldn't get new mattresses delivered until Monday. I said that was ok, and I appreciated his honesty about how bad the mattresses were, and his willingness to deal with the situation. Well, on Monday no mattresses arrived, nor any message from Jack or Liz about a change of plans. After two of my emails went unanswered, Liz finally answered to say that the existing mattresses were actually fine (!), that she's slept in the flat many times and that she's never had complaints before!!!! She didn't bother explaining how Jack could have been so wrong in his assessment. She had the nerve to tell me ""different beds suit different people I guess"". If the two mattresses were not of throw-away quality, why would Jack suggest replacing them immediately if they were not crappy?? The reason i'm making a big deal of this, as I've told Liz, is that the ONLY question I had of Liz before renting the flat was whether the mattresses were of decent quality.  She misrepresented the facts, and then despite her partner Jack agreeing with me, she would not admit she had lied to me. So buyer beware of what Liz has to say! I would suggest looking elsewhere.

Only miss was laundry and maid services for daily cleaning was not there and we were asked to pay if we choose. If you are planning to stay for more than a day then pls be ready to keep house clean and before leaving also it was clearly instructed that flat needs to be handover in the aame condition.

True to the past reviews Grace has recieved, she is prompt in getting back in touch with you. In my case at 11.45pm so that we could be confirmed for the next evening.

She is a fantastic hostess with a home thats as warm as her. She welcomed us with open arms and an open heart and never made us feel like guests.

person. Our room was quite adequate and overlooked the garden. The neighborhood is a very interesting mix of Hasidic Jews and Asians.
Breakfast provisions were excellent-exotic yogurt flavors we cannot get in the U.S. Grace was kind enough to leave an umbrella at our door on a day that looked like it might rain and she served as our alarm clock one morning when we had to rise at 5:30AM. The closest tube is Brent Cross-a brisk 10 minute walk. We would highly recommend staying with Grace G.

I can't say enough about her and her home. Grace was a very gracious, helpful host. Her home was cleaner and more comfortable than some hotel rooms I've been in. Her kitchen was always stocked with food for a self catered breakfast (which was really helpful when your a tourist and don't really want to waste time eating out for breakfast.) and it was always clean.

The room was a comfortable size with a comfortable bed and wifi. There is a shared bathroom, but even with the two other rooms in the house occupied, it wasn't a problem.

The location was perfect for us. It was a relly easy commute to central London. After sightseeing in the heart of London, it was nice to go back to the peace and quiet of a neighborhood.

The breakfast is simple as wel, but ok. The rooms are very close (7 minutes walk) to the Bent Cross tube station, so that's a big pro. Personally, I liked the neighborhood. 

In my eyes there´s only one serious point for improvement. When lying on the bed I could feel the springs. They were not stabbing and pointy, but not comforting as wel... On the other side: I heard from many people that's a common problem in London, even in above average Hotels like Holiday In Express.

Grace was more than helpful, she emailed me with valuable information before  I arrived.  Since this was my first time in London this information helped to ground me.
The home is spotless, organized and pleasant.  Grace goes out of her way to offer any assistance that is required.  I would definetly return and recommend this home.
Keep up the good work Grace, you deserve a lot of credit for your business sense and organizational skills.

A very walkable area and easy to find things like grocery stores and bars. I recommend going to Pret A Manger across from Russell Square for quick grab and go food.  ",en,0.05

Mike's very laid back and friendly and but we really didn't get to talk to him much because we had a lot of things on our schedule. He had no issues with us coming and going as we pleased, and we tended to return to the flat pretty late. He was also accommodating about storing our luggage or letting us check in early if we arrived before the check-in time (depending on whether or not there was another tenant still there). Just let him know ahead of time to see if this can be arranged. 

The closest Tube station is Russell Square off the Piccadilly line, but the Chancery Lane and Holborn stations off the Central line are a short walk away and maybe more convenient depending on where you're going. You could also just walk everywhere, especially if the weather is nice. Lots of attractions are very close by.

Communication with Michael was excellent and he replied within a few hours for every email as well! We were going to return to London after a few days in Paris and he was kind enough to offer to let us leave some bulky luggages at his place!

The location is ideal and within short walking distance to Kings' Cross and Russell Square, and another few minutes to Oxford Street. And for such a central location not overly noisy at night time. It's also safe enough for a woman to walk around on her own (I did so at 23.30 o'clock). 

Michael is the friendliest host you can imagine, welcoming, makes you feel at ease, gives hints and tips for pretty much everything, discusses ""rules"" and expectations open from the beginning (and they were all along my own expectations, so it worked really well). He was very generous at letting me drop off my bags early and leaving them longer so I didn't have to lug them around.

He was there to greet me when I got into town and was good about helping me with everything from just getting the bags up the stairs (I was exhausted!) and getting settled in. He was kind enough to share his tips about the best places to visit and even the best route for doing the tour around town so as to maximize the number of things I could see in my time there. 

The room was quite large and very relaxed. The bed was especially comfortable and his home is on a side street so it was fairly quiet (I value my sleep! - especially with jet lag in place).  His place is only a block or two from the nearest metro (which has a 24 hour quik-e-mart in front for a cheap sandwich or simple groceries if you want to save money and not eat at restaurants for every meal). 

Overall, definitely a great host and he and I had lots to talk about when I was there. He seems genuinely interested in making new friends around the world and I suspect this is one of the main reasons he hosts people in his home. If you are looking for a kind hearted person to welcome you when you are visiting London, Michael's definitely the man. I would strongly recommend staying with him....you won't regret it.

The water pressure in the shower wasn't exactly the strongest I've ever experienced, but that's par for the course for many older buildings -- I only mention it because if, for example, you have long, thick hair like I do, it's just a thing to keep in mind.

During the staying(3 weeks), even we have two kids, but we seldom took a tube or a bus.
To all excellent visiting point, we could reach by walk. (As you know central London lovely place and deserve to spend time by walking all day long)
GB Museum, Covent Garden, Regent-street, National gallery, many musical theaters... etc.
I am pretty sure that we luckily stay in Central London with this accommodation fee.

Michael has considered my family very carefully, sometimes we didn't recognize we were sharing the place with him, but when we need help as a local guide, then he kindly helped us with a great sense of humor.

The place is very cozy; if you want some entertainment types of equipment (e.g., TV), then you should bring some. For us, it has no problem; we just wanted a place for sleeping, eating, and using restroom including shower.

Definitely, recommend the place to you, and I will contact Michael when I revisit central London.

The house is located on a quiet street and there was plenty of room for us. The beds were very comfortable. Geert's description and pictures are very accurate. There was no need for us to rent a vehicle. We used the Underground and Rail services to all our destinations. The Eastbound side of Kew Gardens Underground has a wonderful array of local stores that we found very convenient. There's a butcher, health food store, 2-3 restaurants, Starbucks, pub, barber, and so on. There are ""Retail Shops"" within a 5 minute walk of the house. All your food and basic needs are available within a 5 minute walk of the house. Also, Kew Gardens is really quite a beautiful area.

Should you decide to rent a vehicle, be aware that there is only parking on the road and it's very limited. Also, the house is on a flight path, so you will hear planes flying overhead. However, it didn't bother any of us at all.

Geert is very familiar with London and is able to provide you with directions and tips. Be sure to use his expertise. He speaks an number of languages fluently and is easy to communicate with. He is very helpful.

This was the first time we rented via airbnb.com and we had a very positive experience.

The house is also near a train track - which after a day or two I no longer noticed.  His descriptions of the size of rooms and beds is also accurate - some are small, but serve the purpose.

36299,24846640,2015-01-03,11488327,David,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and Geert made it an excellent one from start to finish.  We have a family with three young children, and it made all the difference in the world to stay in a quiet residential neighborhood on the edge of London rather than in a hotel.  It really felt like ""coming home"" every night, a much better experience for the family.  The property is very well kept, in a nice neighborhood just a short walk to the tube.  There are a few restaurants nearby in Kew Gardens, and we found a great variety of excellent places to eat in nearby Richmond (5 min or so by car, bus or train/tube).  

What really set things apart was how friendly and helpful Geert was throughout the process.  He was very responsive to messages and went above and beyond to offer lots of helpful advice to make our visit to London more enjoyable.  He provided a very useful ""house manual"" with practical advice on the house as well as public transport and local sights, along with a number of local pocket guidebooks that helped us daily as we planned our excursions with the kids.  Most notably, we encountered some unexpected maintenance closures on the tube during our visit and Geert emailed me back before the next morning with several detailed maps and suggestions for alternate ways to get too and from central London.  What could have been a major headache on our holiday was no problem thanks to Geert's timely and practical advice. 

If you do drive a car, it is worth noting that there is ample on-street parking in the neighborhood, and Geert was kind enough to arrange in advance for resident day parking permits for us to use.   For days that we traveled into London, we relied on public transportation and bought day passes which were a great value and allowed unlimited use of tube/bus/train.  

Throughout the experience from booking to departure, Geert took a genuine interest to see that we had a nice holiday and enjoyed our stay at his house. ",en,0.048250265111346766

The house is quite near to the Kew gardens and 2 minutes walk to the river Thames. On the days we wanted to go to central London we used underground, for which station is at walking distance.

The house is quite nice with 3 bedrooms which suited perfectly for our family of 4. The house is quite airy and has good natural light. There is a large private garden.

The entire area is quite green and walk up to the river Thames is also quite scenic. Plenty of birds are audible and visible. Occasionally we see cats (and a fox once) - which my children loved.

Even though it is in a quiet residential neighborhood, super markets and shops less than 10 minutes walk. Reasonable pubs and restaurants are within walking distances.

The kitchen is quite large and well equipped. Utensils and cutlery are high quality. One bathroom is proper size. One toilet is quite small. One caution that there is no storage space for the guests.

Fide was extremely helpful and Roger was very friendly and always checked in on us to see if everything was OK.  The continental style breakfast was also wonderful and with more than enough food to choose from to start one's day.

A beautiful guest lodge, one we'd most certainly stay at again on our next trip to London.  We can recommend this place highly, so do yourself a favour and book with Agri and Roger, you won't be disappointed.

You're more than guaranteed to love the place, in fact if you don't love it, I'll eat my hat!

Agri, thanks for the bubbly you left for us for our honeymoon, just sorry we never got to enjoy it, as we were out late most night, making the most of our short time (only 2.5days) in London.  A most thoughful gesture, thanks again for that personal touch!

They positively support, generously share, and are personally involved and interested in their guests having a fabulous time in London! I love East Finchley (where they (Website hidden by Airbnb) where the Underground comes out of the dark tunnels of central London and meets the light of day...literally! I'm vegetarian but it was no problem getting meals locally...Agri and Roger had several recommendations. Also they are no newbies to London and Agri often knows what bus numbers to take in North London and where to change to get where you want to go. Roger is an avid gardener and the landscaping of the property is beautiful...the view from my room was heavenly. If I go back to London next year there is no doubt as to where I'll be (Website hidden by Airbnb) only hope is that they will have room for me as I understand they are already taking bookings into the middle of next year!

The garden room where we had the chance to sleep was big, very comfy, clean and so pretty ! It's like a dream to wake up there, have a cup of warm coffee served by Agri, say hello to Roger and go drink it in ""your"" own part of the garden. Very very lovely way to start your day, even more when there's sunshine. We also took our breakfast in the common veranda and it was very pleasant, there's a lot of choice (and a lot of people, not very surprising for this marvelous place). The place is filled with flowers which is lovely. Everything is clean.I'd just warn people who have light sleep that the garden room is next to the bathroom so you'll hear people using it at all times, but it's not awful, I found sleep quite well anyway.

Agri and Roger and two wonderful hosts who provide and experience to their guests.  They are wonderfully personable, you can have wonderful communications with others from all over the world at their breakfast table, and you get a fine bed to sleep on.  I have stayed in most every room at the Lodge and I will say I have no special one.  I highly recommend the Blenheim Lodge as a great place to stay.  There is no warmer AirBNB host than Agri and Rodger.  I a sure I will be seeing them again soon.",en,0.03865546218487395

They were very helpful with advise and information, as well as generous with their space- we were able to use the kitchen and the fridge. We stayed in two different rooms and loved them both, not to mention the garden and Bam Bam the cat. Breakfast was UNBELIEVABLE - there was something there for almost every taste! We could have spent the whole day at the dining room, just eating, chatting, and enjoying the view of the beautiful garden, created by Roger. The house is well-located, with easy access to the Underground. ",en,0.059113300492610835
