I found Marcelas place which was possible to book via instant-booking.
I was a bit worried how things would work, but I got hold of Marcela and everything worked out.
The place is a typical Airbnb place with all necessary and not much extra. It was nice, neat and clean and had AC/heating although it was a bit noisy.

The apartment is exactly as in the pictures, and was clean and tidy. The location is perfect.  Subway station, bars, grocery stores and restaurants are within walking distance.  The balcony is nice and overlooks the ""Santuario del Cerro San Cristóbal.""

Everything was spotless and the host was fantastic —  our plane was delayed quite a bit and he was still ready to check us in well into the middle of the night at 1am - thank you, Cristian! Everything in the apartment was tasteful, brand new and functional. The location was extremely convenient with a metro station (Manuel Montt) literally downstairs, a supermarket around the next corner and a handful of nice places to eat close by. 

Being the 21st floor, it had a breathtaking view of the whole city of Santiago, including a glimpse of the Andes on the background and the beautiful Fuente Bicentenario, which has a light show at night (a must-see in person).

The maid came every other day and kept everything in order. The kitchen was equipped for light meals (including oven, blender, toaster, microwave, kettle etc) and an assortment of dishes/glasses. The shower pressure was fantastic, better than at our own house (wife was thrilled for her long hair). The bed was very comfy with quality cotton linen and soft pillows. I also must praise the light-speed internet connection, best wi-fi we’ve ever had on a trip abroad (we’re talking 6MiB/s here). The TV on the bedroom had all-access cable, the perfect companion for a relaxing night after a long day out.

No instructions on WIFI, which of the three remote controls does what (had to play a guessing game) and specifics on how the cleaning service works.

Raul also helped me book my transit back to the ariport on my day of departure.  It was so comforting knowing how available and helpful Raul was during my stay in Santiago!

Raul's apartment was adorable and in a great location.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I could frequently smell smoke (maybe through the walls?) and there was quite a bit of noise by the other residents.

The apartment is a little more 'tired' that the pictures show.  It is also quite noisy day and night (people, dogs, car alarms etc).  

That said, Raul was welcoming and friendly, helping us with local Information.   He also dropped in a new plug for the toaster and a cloth to clean the floor as, although swept, it was clearly not mopped.

If your flight comes in before check out time, you will be forced to pay an extra night. Something that should be mentioned before you book the place as you do not get a full refund for cancellation. There was a lot of dust around the apartment as if the floors weren't vacuumed for a while. Also- bring your own towel! The towels provided were very rough and stiff. Felt more like floor mat towels than ones you would use to dry off. 
The apartment gets cold at night (during the time I went the weather was cold in Chile). There is a small heater in the closet that I found and helps a little if you put it close to the bed. 
I never met Raul, he sent another lady to meet me for check in. She arrived late and was unorganized in her paperwork. She did not show me around the apartment or tell me where anything was. She just said feel free to look around. She did not give me any helpful tips or information or maps. Luckily I already had most of my activities planned through trip advisor before I got to Chile.

I thought it was cool that they left us a little mini bottle of wine. The apartment is really beautiful, but looks more spacious on the site. The kitchen doesn't have all the necessary items to cook your own food, so be ready to eat chinese delivery or get a cab to a better part of the city. The people on her floor were partying until something like 3 in the morning and it was loud and kept us up. Someone on the other side of the wall was making love and we could hear the bed slamming against the wall just a few feet away from us. It was freaky. She never provided us with the internet password, which caused a lot of complications for our stay and finding our way around the area. The TV wasn't working. The awesome pool and grill were locked for a long maintenance period so we never got to use them despite the heat outside, and the fact that it says that all of these services will be available to you on her page. I told her all this and she offered me 30 dollars back from our whole stay, but I don't have a chilean bank account so I couldn't do that. Pretty disappointing experience, given how great it looks online. I would recommend staying with Matthew Craze who is listed in the Santaigo section.

We had to live with our coats on inside... not really nice. There are often water cuts in the building which (with 26 floors) hosts hundreds of people.

She waited in for me even though I was four hours late and gave me tea and cake to help me get my strength back. She even offered me supper on my first night even though she doesn't normally cook meals. She gave me a good breakfast each day and was happy to adapt it to the tastes of her guests. She helped me with advice about places to see and how to get there.
The second best feature was how convenient her flat is for getting to all the main places that a tourist or student would want.  It is a short safe  walk and less than ten minutes door to train at the local metro station Manquehue. This line is very cheap, clean and efficient and mostly not too crowded. Close to her flat there is a large modern supermarket as well as a shopping centre with a food court. There is a pharmacy, green grocer, a cafe and a cake shop within 100 meters.

There were great views of the city and mountains from the bedroom and living room's large balconies. There were thick curtains that kept sun out early in the mornings. 
The apartment had a fully equipped kitchen and washing machine which was handy plus air con in the living room and bedroom. 
The UK super king bed was very comfortable and there was an ensuite to the bedroom. Could perhaps provide some more towels when staying more than a couple of days (only had one large bath towel each and one hand towel to share).
Apparently there was a swimming pool on the roof but we weren't informed until we were leaving. 
The location is very good, felt safe late at night. Central and good transport (buses and subway) just round the corner and shops, restaurants and cafes.
Hector was efficient, polite and helpful, answering emails quickly.

The metro is an easy 5-minute walk from the apartment, and there is a small local market right at the bottom of the apartment complex if you want fresh fruits and delicious empanadas. There is also a small convenience store and pharmacy across the street if you've forgotten anything like shampoo or toothbrush or whatever. The apartment was sparkling clean and very comfortable. The sun does warm up the place quite a bit in the afternoon, but there is AC to keep it cool. There is a nice view over Cerro San Cristobal. We enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely rent it again if we come back to Santiago.

And the location was great, right next to a great market (best empanadas in Santiago according to locals, incredibly delicious according to me) as well as a tourist center and post office within 1/2 a block. Easy walking to most points of interest along safe, well-lit main avenue. Hector was very helpful in getting us settled and arranging a customized tour, he has a lot of knowledge about the area and the history. Coincidentally, our tour was on the anniversary of the coup (9/11) and he incorporated a lot of this fascinating history as we traveled through the city. Additionally, when we arrived at the aiport, we were held up in immigration and custom for almost 2 hours* and the driver that he sent patiently waited the whole time for us. We were so happy to see him when we finally made it through and he was very kind and courteous despite the long wait.  The staff at the apartment is also very helpful, especially Liborio (sp?) so you are not left stranded if you need basic tips on the neighborhood, etc...all in all, a great experience and good value over a hotel. Hector is also super responsive to any questions that may come up and gets back to e-mails very quickly. He is running a really professional operation.

The apartment is well located, close to metro station and quick uber ride to most of the popular tourist spots. It has everything one needs to survive a few days vacation however, if you’re staying long periods of time, some things might tick you off as it did for me. The response time from everyone was great and everything i asked while I was there they did (only a couple of things)..

The CONS (for long stays in my view as I stayed almost 2 months for work)

There is no couch, only 2 VERY uncomfortable chairs. If you want to lounge and decompress after a long day of work, these chairs will not do. The tub in the bathroom has partial coverage, so most of the water WILL spill out, no matter how careful and the bathroom rug was ALWAYS soaked and at times i had to hang it from the balcony to dry. I would suggest investing in a complete closure (it’s not that expensive). The sink faucet is too small for the vessel sink, washing hands is nearly impossible (again, another cheap investment). The a/c works fine for the bedroom, but it is not enough for the entire apartment. I was there in the summer, i hate the heat and it was almost impossible to stay in the living room during the day specially because the aptm is facing west (afternoon sun exposure). This is my opinion as freezing A/C is a MUST for me. The building has a pool but forget about using it on weekends in the summer, it’s tiny and if more than 5 people are up there at a time, you have to sit on the floor in the pool surroundings.",en,Entire home/apt,3,No

The private room/bath has everything you need and if not, Bernardita will bend over backwards to make sure you're comfortable.

Bernardita made sure that everything would go smoothly by promptly responding to my inquires before/after booking the room and being there for me during my stay.  Understanding the concerns about the water/food, she prepared meals using the purified water and disinfecting/washing fruits and vegetables without showing any sign of annoyance. I could feel that what is important for her is to make sure her guests are having a great time. 

Bernardita is so giving, and so are her friends and family members who all made me feel part of the family, despite my short stay.

Also, since Bernardita makes curtains and tailors clothes, she has an excellent taste in fabric, which explains the high quality of the bed sheets, bed covers, etc. that she made herself!

My stay in Santiago was unbelievable, and I would like to thank her to make that possible!",en,Private room,3,No

I arrived to a very warm welcome, a cup of coffee and some delicious lemon pie.  The room and private bathroom were very well presented.  The breakfast she provided was organised to my likes, not just needs.  I also made the most of her offer of a ride to the airport when I found the alternative shared taxi presented complications and was not possible at the time I wanted to go.  That was obviously very convenient for me and her rates were quite reasonable.
Bernadetta makes you feel right at home.  It really put my Spanish to the test - I had my longest Spanish conversation ever over a cup of tea in the afternoon.  Mind you she manages very well with non Spanish speakers too with some help from translator apps.

I went in winter expecting the heating to be central in the home, but it is not common for Chilean homes to have, so make sure to dress appropriately if you come during their winter!  There is a heating pad in the bed which was nice as well.  There were a few dogs barking outside my room, but at night, it was quiet enough to sleep well.  The shower is nice and hot, but the heat lasts shorter than in most US homes, so make sure not to take too long or you'll have to wait for it to warm up again.

1. no internet, but the owner promised that if we stay he provides internet. Internet connection very important for me because I need to make my job every day and I told him about it. But during our stay nothing changed. It was just a promise. Internet was not provided even when I reminded him about it. He said it would take 3 days for installation. Gone 3 days no internet again. I asked him again and he began to ignore me. It was first signal.
2. To make us stay in his place He also promised moto tour around Santiago and tour to Vina del Mar on weekends. When we paid for this room he forgot everything  and it never happend.
3. Top of negative we got in our last 2 days staying when he had a night party with friends at 2 a.m. it was really noisy and we could not sleep. On the next day I asked him that it is our last night and we need to have a good sleep, please dont make a noise. He said okey and at 2 a.m we got a party again. I have no words about it.
4. It is a small room in a really small apartment maximum for 2 persons.
5. He lives with his girl friend but said before that he lives alone
6. He farms a weed on his balcony
7.The last action that made us sure that he is not appropriate person. When we was leaving we had no sleep all night (see point 3) and because of that forgot keys inside the room. We are sorry about it but we had no idea that he does not have extra keys. After this we started to recieve threatening messages in (Hidden by Airbnb) . He works at customs in the airport so he will tell his friends co-workers and will inform Interpol and we will have problems at a custom when we will leave the country. The most funny thing is that he forgot his keys in the appartment just a few days before.

She loves to tell stories about her experiences and travel and is a pleasure to be around!  She is so helpful.  Her location is two blocks from the metro station, and from there you can take connecting metros and the bus terminal anywhere, Vina Del Mar is only 90 minutes by bus, and works out beautifully if you want to see both Santiago and the coast, along with Casablanca and the wine lands.

She actually did a load of laundry for me and gave me ride to a hostel. Her home is an very nice gated community in funky part of town.  A few drawbacks are the place is much smaller than it looks.  The kitchen is very tiny and you can just about turn around, but its very clean.  The bedroom is small and really is her daughters and she has all of her stuff on the shelves.  I didn't know Nitza smokes cigarettes and if the is an issue you need to know that.  She smokes outside, but the smell is the smell. Overall, i you want a nice place, close to the Brasil district and with a sense of community I think for few days to get situated Nitza is a good choice.  You are really getting what you pay for so just see it for what it is. I am sure there are much better and much worse.  Yet like I say, I like her.

Though I never met Nitza, she seems to speak some English as initially we communicated via texting in English; but I can´t evaluate how well she speaks it. I do know she makes every effort to communicate and was very quick and effective in responding to my questions (eventually, in Spanish). I believe Javier speaks some English as well, but we communicated mostly in Spanish.
The room is small and without many hangers, but ideal for a single traveler who is roughing it a bit. There was excellent wifi at the house, which is in a middle/working class complex. 

The complex is located in Yunguy, which I grew to love. There are many cool murals in Yungay and some in nieghboring Brazil (neighborhood). While initially I didn´t know what to make of the writing on the buildings across the street, I came to see it as merely a form of public expression.

Hector was terrific! We can say with full confidence that he always delivered well beyond our expectations. Not only was the apartment he rented us well furnished, immaculately clean, and in a great upscale Santiago neighborhood, but Hector's service as a tour guide was outstanding. He was very personable, reliable, and highly knowledgeable, and knew a great many sights that were not overly touristed. He was easy to get a hold of, organized, and knows what he's doing, and when we wanted to deviate from the plan to seek out some unique sights he was flexible and did his utmost to locate them without objection. We really enjoyed Hector's very friendly and easygoing manner, and highly recommend both him as a tour guide and his accommodations as an exceptional value.

But once again, if you are looking for the Airbnb experience of someone else cozy apartment with the ""home"" feeling, this is not it. This is an apart hotel with the same price leves as other apart hotels in Santiago of that size.  ",en,Entire home/apt,3,No

The balcony looks onto a nice vista and is on the 15th floor. A definite plus with this appartment is the full air conditioning which seems to be quite rare in many short stay Santiago appartments. As it was +30c when we were both in Santiago in early March, this was a definite advantage. I think we would have felt pretty uncomfortable without it! 

All the furnishings in the appartment were of a high quality and the bed was very comfy. The apartment is exactly as it looks on the photos.  

The appartment is quite compact, but still roomy enough and more than comfortable for 2 people. 

Roxana was very efficient and patient in replying to all our questions and correspondence and this also goes for her colleague who met us at the appartment as well as the reception staff and the taxi service booked with the appartment. I would highly recommend this appartment to anyone wanting a safe and comfortable place to stay in Santiago. We stayed for 8 nights. Truly magical.

The flat looks exactly as the photos but the only problem is the noise from the street (traffic) but it is normal in a big city.
I used to live in Santiago (Providencia) and I know how safe and quiet is, so I recommended to my foreign friends to rent  this flat, for that reason  I will do the same for anyone who wants to have a good experience in Santiago.

We arrived earlier than check-in time, and the staff allowed us to leave our luggage in the apartment while we grabbed lunch and waited until check-in time.

The location is walking distance from plenty of restaurants and bars, metro stations, and parks. We could not have asked for a better location. 

The apartment itself was just as advertised, and comfortable for three people. It was in excellent condition and well furnished as shown in the pictures.

The picture shown is mirrored but it is accurate! This place is GORGEOUS.  The beds were fabulous and the bathroom was divine. I have no complaints!  There was an electric kettle (which I love), and a complete kitchen with a stove, oven, microwave, and a fridge/freezer.  I loved it!! The room is on the 5th floor and you have to be buzzed into the lobby by security.  It is located in Nueva Providencia which was nice because it was walking distance to a lot. There are grocery stores across the street and SO many malls in the area!  Make sure you visit Cerro Santa Lucía (St. Luica Hill) which is a park in middle of the city. The view from the top is phenomenal.  Oh, and if you need an adapter for the outlets (they have three small circular holes) we found some USB ones at Jumbo, the only supermercado in the Costanera Center.

To start with, he was a great and gracious host; he was there to welcome us when we arrived, showed us around the flat, explained how things worked and gave us the keys, a card for the metro and a mobile phone - very handy to have an extra one. I have to say that on other occasions when we've rented flats in Santiago through other websites, sometimes the keys were just left at the Reception desk for us and we never saw our host.
Eugenio had also left a bottle of mineral water, fresh fruit and stocked the fridge with some food and drink to get us going. There was even a vase full of flowers at the entrance and a Christmas tree and decorations waiting for us!!! We thought that was a lovely gesture and made us feel very welcome. During our stay, he made sure we were OK, keeping in touch if necessary through email, leaving for us extra information about Santiago or little treats.
The flat itself was great, spacious, comfortable and very clean. As one of the other guests points out, it's even bigger than what it appears in the photos, and there is plenty of storage space in the master bedroom and the kitchen. There was basically everything we needed for our stay or to get us going, from spare bed sheets and towels to washing liquid for the washing machine, with a well-equipped kitchen and utility room. Being on the 12th floor [11th to us, as we don't count the ground floor!) provided us with great views of Santiago towards the Andes. Yes, we were surrounded by other buildings but the height helps not to make it feel claustrophobic at all. We also had 'our own' metro entrance/exit, just steps away from the building and, as an added bonus, a taxi rank next to it so moving around Santiago was extremely easy and hassle-free. The area is exactly as described on the website and we even got to try a couple of the nearby restaurants. One of them was just before the end of the holiday, when Eugenio kindly invited us for a farewell lunch and we could have a really good chat with him.
This was the first time we rented through Airbnb and it was a very positive experience, even from the first contacts with potential hosts. We enjoyed our stay here so very much we hope the next time we go to Santiago to visit our family we can stay here again, it did feel like a home from home. Thanks, Eugenio, for helping to make it a great holiday!!!

He made himself available at all times by quickly replying to our emails (and I mean, within minutes).

The flat is spacious and located near Escuela Militar in Las Condes, a nice and safe area. We found the apartment to be in excellent and tidy state. The windows dim the daily and nightly city noises to a low hum. Electric heaters are available that allowed for convenient room temperatures during colder winter nights. The kitchen is well equipped and everything was functioning. Porters at the reception desk were very friendly and courteous. The flat is not toddler-safe, so we had to move some items to places out of reach for the curious hands of our 2-year old. The laundry patio in the kitchen and the balcony have some significant fall risk for small unattended children, but we were made aware of that before arrival. Eugenio has been a very friendly host, caring, and any questions or ""problemitas"" we had were answered / solved quickly, e.g. a broken light bulb was replaced the same day and an extra spare provided.

Apartment itself is fantastic. It is really huge and there is absolutely everything you would need. I can't even think about what else would need to be added. The location is also very good. It is within a minute from the metro station, there is a taxi rank nearby and it is very easy to access the main motorways if you are driving.

There is a narrow opened terrace along the apartment and you can see the whole neighborhood from there. There are also two covered terraces which I think would be great to be in during the summer time. But when we stayed it was quite chilly so we preferred the warmth of the very nice radiators. If you are lucky to have a clear day the views from one of the sides is absolutely stunning - the Andes covered in snow!!

Las Condes is a very fine neighborhood of Santiago, easily accessible to the centro and other noteworthy parts of the city.
The metro is literally outside the door, and there is a full grocery within ten minutes walking.

This twelfth-floor penthouse apartment is everything the pictures show and more.
This apartment is spacious, with magnificent terrace views in three directions.
It has a fully-equipped kitchen, which is not always true in my experience.
The Wi-Fi works well and having a washing machine and on-premise parking were features that I was interested in having available.

The neighborhood is very convenient and we got around very easily.  It is very near the transportation to the mountains and ski resorts too which is nice.

The apartment was very nice and very clean. Everyone was kind and helpful. Eugenio was very gracious to let us use a local cell phone and a BEP card to use on the buses and subways. Everything in the apartment was in great condition. The neighborhood is safe and close to a bank, super market, restaurants, and taxi's. The apartment is secure and we never worried about anything. The views from the apartment are nice and we could leave the doors and windows open as the apartment is on the 12th floor. The apartment has everything you will need including a washing machine, iron, TV, and fully equipped kitchen. The apartment had great beds and we were able to relax. Eugenio is a great host who we trust. He communicated with us before our trip and met with us when we arrived. When we return to Santiago, we will make sure to stay with Eugenio and this apartment.

392,919,154395,59272523,2016-01-09,6450886,Ximena,"This was the second time my husband, my son and I stayed with Eugenio - three weeks over the Christmas and New Year period to visit family in Santiago -  and it really felt like coming home! The flat was exactly as it was the first time two years ago and immaculately clean. Eugenio had again left a few nice welcome goodies and put up a Christmas tree and decorations, which made it feel lovely! The day we arrived some of the staff at the reception remembered us from our previous visit and were all extremely kind and helpful.
Busy with a six-month-old baby and work, we didn't get to see Eugenio during our stay, but he kept constantly in touch through email to make sure that we were OK. We were glad he managed to catch up with us the day we left to tell him in person what a good time we had again at his place.  We will definitely stay here on our next visit, even if it is just two of us, because the place and the location are ideal and it is great value for money. All the best, Eugenio!",en,Entire home/apt,1,No

We have stayed in several places in Santiago before, this was our favorite. Everything was as we hoped it would be. Eugenio was helpful and always there when needed. A perfect place if you're staying for more than 3 days.",en,Entire home/apt,1,No
394,922,154395,67842348,2016-03-31,52825343,Hilda,"We stayed in the apartment for one week. The location is great! One of the bedrooms and bathroom is very spacious and comfortable. The second bedroom and bathroom are not. The bunk beds in the second bedroom are uncomfortable and the small bathroom is much too small. 
Eugenio, the host, is very nice. He left a fruit platter to welcome us he also left us a metro card and a phone. We went over Easter, so left a basket with chocolates. Although we didn't meet him personally, we felt like he thought of us enough to give us lots of very practical information about getting around in Santiago and surrounding area. The kitchen and washing facilities, were good. 
I would recommend this apartment to a couple, but not to a family. ",en,Entire home/apt,1,No

He kindly left us provisions for when we first arrived, he was very communicative, and he promptly responded to any questions we had.  The apartment was beautiful and the view of the mountains as spectacular as the photos he posted.  The location of the apartment was extremely convenient being just a 1/2 block from a metro station.  The concierges also were extremely kind and welcoming.  Everyone made for a very nice stay, and we absolutely recommend Eugenio as a host.

Eugenio era un anfitrión excepcional!  Nos dejó provisiones cuando llegamos, y se nos comunicaba bien y rapidamente durante la estadia.  El departamento era hermoso y la vista de la cordillera preciosa.  El departamento estaba ubicada super bien a media cuadra de una estación del metro.

This apartment would easily rank 2nd or 3rd in my list (an apartment in Prague will be always the best). I took my family to Santiago (we live in Australia) - 2 adults and 3 kids. The apartment is close to public transport, safe neighbourhood, parking, etc. In addition Eugenio aims to have a good communication since the booking.

The location could not have been better...just a few steps from the Escuela military Metro station and also has a taxi stand right in front. This made it very convenient. The apartment was very tastefully done up and had a gorgeous view of the Andes. The apartment basically had every thing that one could possibly need. We were very happy with our choice. Eugenio is very responsive and responded to every query within minutes. This area is probably one of the best areas in Santiago to stay and there are plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes close by. It was a short cab ride to the Costanera (the tallest building in South America) which also has a mall and many restaurants. Overall we had a great stay.",en,Entire home/apt,1,No
